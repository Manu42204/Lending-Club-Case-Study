# Lending Club Case Study

Lending club is a largest online Consumer Finance marketplace specializing in offering a variety of loans to urban customers. 
Due to siginificant increase in lending during the year 2010 and 2011, Lending Club has requested for recommendations on driving factors to decrease loan defaults.

Primary objective for this case study is to apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to the available lending data to derive data insights to assist the Lender with understanding the driving factors that lead to loan default (Charged Off) to augument the risk asessment procedures.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
  Analyse the provided data loan set using Exploratory Data Analysis to understand various factors leading to loan default or Fully repaid Loans.
- What is the background of your project?
  Borrowers can apply for various kinds of loans e.g. Personal, business, auto refinancing, etc. 
  Investors can decide whether to finance a loan or not on the basis of loan amount, customer background and etc. 
  Using various driving factors, the lending club can identify the applicants/loans that have higher chance of defaulting and reducing the risk to profitability.

- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
  Lending Club wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and      risk assessment. 
- What is the dataset that is being used?
  loan.csv for the year 2007 and 2011
